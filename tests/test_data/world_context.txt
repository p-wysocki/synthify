Eldoria is a world suspended between realms, with floating islands adorned with vibrant flora and fauna that defy the laws of gravity. Each island is a unique ecosystem, and the skies are filled with majestic creatures like winged serpents and luminous birds.
The heart of Eldoria is the Celestial Nexus, a towering crystalline structure that connects the various islands and channels the magical energies that permeate the realm. The Nexus is guarded by ancient beings known as the Celestial Guardians, who are revered as the protectors of balance in Eldoria.
